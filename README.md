# Programming-Portfolio
This is where I will put all my programs I write in my high school programming class. I like smoothies. 

This is my favorite class where I learn import things

Today I wrote my first program it looked like this:

print "Hello, World!"

I learned that you can turn on the interpreter by typing "python" into terminal
